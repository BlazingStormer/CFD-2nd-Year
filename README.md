CFD analysis of Rocket Nose Cone profiles

In this project I have done CFD analysis of conical and elliptical rocket nose cone profiles to compute the drag force in both cases using ANSYS Fluent. 
For this purpose, I have created the structured meshes for conical and elliptical rocket nose cone using ANSYS ICEM CFD. I have attached the mesh files and the project files in this repository.

conicalmesh2_files.zip contains the ICEM Structured Mesh file of the conical rocket nose cone.

ellipticalmesh_files_zip.zip contains the ICEM Structured Mesh file of the elliptical rocket nose cone.

icemconicalnose_files.zip contains the ANSYS Fluent Analysis of the conical rocket nose cone.

icemellipticalnose_archive.wbpz contains the ANSYS Fluent Analysis of the elliptical rocket nose cone.

conicalmachnumber.jpg contains the mach number contour of the conical rocket nose cone.

conicalpressure.jpg contains the pressure contour of the conical rocket nose cone.

conicalvelocity.jpg contains the velocity contour of the conical rocket nose cone.

DragForceValues.xlsx contains the values of the drag force in both conical and elliptical rocket nose cone cases for various velocities.
