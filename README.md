CFD analysis of Rocket Nose Cone profiles

In this project I have done CFD analysis of conical and elliptical rocket nose cone profiles to compute the drag force in both cases using ANSYS Fluent. 
For this purpose, I have created the structured meshes for conical and elliptical rocket nose cone using ANSYS ICEM CFD. I have attached the mesh files and the project files in this repository.
